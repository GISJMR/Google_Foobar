# Google Foobar
My puzzle solutions from Google Foobar.

Google Foobar is a *secret* web tool created to recruit new employees based on what they search for online. (I can't remember exactly what I was searching for, I think it might have been decorators and wrapper in Python) After I hit search I was prompted by Google asking me if I was "up for a challenge". Which I was!

Google Foobar has 8 levels, where level *i* contains exactly *i* problems and each level seemingly increases in difficulty. I started learning to code in January 2016 so felt these challenges would give me an idea of where I was on my journey. I managed to complete all the challenges up to and including Level 5, Challenge 1. Level 5, Challenge 2 went way beyond my maths knowledge and I unfortunately couldn't continue. Google took my contact details after level 3 to add to their recruitment list. Even if nothing comes of it, I had great fun and learnt a lot,
